A digital dice roller, controlled by Arduino. Each dice is represented by 7 LEDs
that are arranged according to standard [dice pip pattern](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(counting)>).

There are two dice and one button. Pressing the button rolls the dice, displays a sequence
of random numbers, followed by the result.

The LEDs are connected to the Arduino pins
as follows:
